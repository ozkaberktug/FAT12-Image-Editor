# FAT12-Image-Editor
Basic image generator / file explorer for custom or classic floppy disk sized FAT12 file system.

The program lacks "Long File Name" and "Directory" support.
Help page in the program has written in Turkish.

DISCLAIMER: I wrote this program back in 2015 when I was a newby to programming and filesystems, so some funny mistakes or usages may took place. Do whatever you want to do with the code, I don't take any responsibility. But if I help you, in someway, you can give me credits I would be grateful..
